> **歌詞登録ステータス：同期歌詞あり**

```lrc
[01:33.77] Have you got colour in your cheeks?
[01:41.80] Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the type
[01:56.18] That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
[01:58.39] Are there some aces up your sleeve?
[02:02.04] Have you no idea that you're in deep?
[02:04.70] I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
[02:27.11] How many secrets can you keep?
[02:28.19] Cause there's this tune I found
[02:28.72] That makes me think of you somehow
[02:29.23] And I play it on repeat
[02:30.50] Until I fall asleep
[02:31.43] Spilling drinks on my settee
[02:32.25] (Do I wanna know?)
[02:32.70] If this feeling flows both ways?
[02:33.52] (Sad to see you go)
[03:01.82] Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
[03:02.35] (Baby, we both know)
[03:02.63] That the nights were mainly made
[03:02.96] For saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
